## Description

The DESUL organization and project will contain open source common core
components for DOE applications and libraries with a focus on C++ development
and standardization. This is intended to cover high performance computing
system software and development libraries and helpers as well as possibly
fundamental computer science algorithms and basic components and
examples and/or proxy codes related to the other components.  It is not
intended to cover scientific applications, or applications in general with the
exception of development tools and scripts.

This is a cross-lab effort to share more core components between library and
runtime teams at LLNL and Sandia as a start, possibly more later. It's meant
to serve as an organization/repository where we can collaborate on open codes
useful to multiple projects and sites.
